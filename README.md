# CSGO-Round-Winner-Project

I am done this project as a Data Scientist Intern at Intellipaat Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

Technologies:- Data Science

Domain:- Sports

Tools:- Python (Jupiter Notbook)

Problem Statement:- The objective of this project is to build and compare multiple machine learning algorithms for the classification of round winners in the game CS:GO. Implement all machine learning algorithms that you have learnt. Explore the data and apply feature selection and engineering. Check which machine learning models perform best on this dataset.

Dataset Description:- CS:GO is a tactical shooter, where two teams (CT and Terrorist) play for a best of 30 rounds, with each round being 1 minute and 55 seconds. There are 5 players on each team (10 in total) and the first team to reach 16 rounds wins the game. At the start, one team plays as CT and the other as Terrorist. After 15 rounds played, the teams swap side. There are 7 different maps a game can be played on. You win a round as a Terrorist by either planting the bomb and making sure it explodes, or by eliminating the other team. You win a round as CT by either eliminating the other team, or by disarming the bomb, should it have been planted. CSGO round winner dataset contains 122410 records with 97 attributes.

Project Objective:- Machine learning models showed promising results in recent studies, improving predictions of outcomes, both, in traditional sports and esports. This thesis tries to come up with different sample representations and prediction models to predict outcomes of CS: GO matches. In this study, we have chosen to tackle the problem directly as classification task, i.e., predicting the winner of the game as one of the competing teams. Proposed sample representations then consist of player representation consisting of player statistics calculated to round average, team representation consisting of roster’s ability to win percentages of classified rounds, and representation combining the two representations.

Future Possibilities of the Project:- In pursue of this goal, first, a dataset of substantial volume had been scraped and stored in a database specifically designed to allow for future work and scalability, exceeding any other datasets freely available, both, in size, and features offered. Sports have been around us for as long as we can remember, with the documented history going back thousands of years. What may have started as one of the ways to prepare for an incoming war or perhaps a hunt, became an important part of today’s cultural society. Over the years, sports have developed from throwing spears and rocks in a numerous different way for people to compare their skills.

Conclusion of the Project:- This thesis’ goal was to perform an exploratory machine learning study regarding outcome prediction in professional matches of CS: GO. Machine learning models showed promising results in recent studies, improving predictions of outcomes, both, in traditional sports and esports. This thesis tries to come up with different sample representations and prediction models to predict outcomes of CS: GO matches. Moreover, the predictions might also profit from other sample representations based on features like tournament phase, vote-ban phase, map number in a series, previous head-to-head team performances, and such, providing further context to each match.
